1) Prediction of price of a medicinal drug based on its production cost


additional info : Company has manufactured the same drug previously and we have data available for
        previous production cost & associated selling price



In Machine learning

            from available
                        ----->2 types of attributes(columns)

                        i)  Columns to be used for modelling
                        ii) THE ATTRIBUTE THAT IS TO BE PREDICTED/DECIDED


Index             




Hint : Univariate Linear Regression
feature : production cost
label  : selling price








2)  Prediction of price of a medicine based on production, marketing, legal & testing costs

Hint :  Multivariate linear regression

    feature----->production, marketing, legal & testing costs
    Target -----> price of medicine

3)  Deciding whether a drug is ready for use based on trials performed on patients with parameters

            Gender,
            Age
            Presence of Other Ailments
            Placebo test



Steps to start creating a ML model


1) Identify the type of problem (regression, classification, clustering)

            Regression : Predicting a value(Target) based on one or more correlated factors     (features)

e.g :   Closing prize of Pfizer will be correlated with Opening?

            classification : separate data points into categories (classes) based on features

            e.g : 1000 cancer patient.

                  age, stage, other ailments,        SURVIVED
                                                        YES
                                                         NO


           clustering :  Create clusters of data points based on one or more factors but HISTORICALLY LABELLED DATA IS NOT PRESENT

2) Prepare your data for modelling

        -----> 1) names of features of labels(renaming)
        -----> 2) Drop irrelevant columns (columns which are not to be used as features)
        -----> 3) Handle missing values (using one of the known techniques)
        -----> 4) encode features & labels(target) if required

                    GENDER : "MALE", "FEMALE"
